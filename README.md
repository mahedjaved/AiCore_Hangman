# Project Title - Hangman (AiCore)

Project aims to develop a digital clone of the popular word guessing game Hangman. The computer (in this eg) guesses a word and stores it in memory. It then iteratively asks whether the user guessed the word correctly or not.

# Code Organisation

#TODO speak about how Python scripts are organised into sections

Each of the milestones are devided into seperate .py files

The .py files are further divided into seperate tasks that can run into seperate code cells in VSCode

#TODO optimise the unique character building, currently it is done by storing indices to pop

# Special Cases

The following is used to special cases if

1. A '_' in the word :
   [Solution adopted] word.replace('_', ' ')

# Table of Contents

(1) milestone_2.py : Basic draft code that checks a user's input and checks if the input is a single alphabet

(2) milestone_3.py : Develops code from milestone_2.py however make sure that if the user's input is invalid then continue asking via an infinite loop. Organises the user input request and guess checking in two seperate functions
