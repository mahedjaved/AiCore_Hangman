# Project Title - Hangman (AiCore)

Project aims to develop a digital clone of the popular word guessing game Hangman. The computer (in this eg) guesses a word and stores it in memory. It then iteratively asks whether the user guessed the word correctly or not.

From Course : Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

# Special Cases

The following is used to special cases if

1. A '-' in the word :
   [Solution adopted] word.replace('-', ' ')

# Table of Contents

(1) milestone_2.py : basic draft code that checks a user's input and checks if the input is a single alphabet

(2) milestone_3.py : develop code from milestone_2.py however make sure that if the user's input is invalid then continue asking via an infinite loop
