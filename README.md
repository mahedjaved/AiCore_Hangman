This should take you 2 hours
Add documentation to your GitHub README file. You can refer to the relevant lesson in the prerequisites for this task for more information.

At minimum, your README file should contain the following information:

Project Title
Table of Contents, if the README file is long
A description of the project: what it does, the aim of the project, and what you learned
Installation instructions
Usage instructions
File structure of the project
License information
You don't have to write all of this at once, but make sure to update your README file as you go along, so that you don't forget to add anything.
